#🚗 #Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that predicts used car prices based on features like year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine details.

A Linear Regression model was first implemented but gave poor results due to non-linear patterns in the dataset. A Random Forest Regressor was later applied, which provided much better performance.

#⚙️ #Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical calculations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

#📊 #Dataset

Features: Name, Year, KM Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, Owner, Mileage, Engine, Power
Target Variable: Price (in INR Lakhs)

#🔎 #Approach

Data Preprocessing – handled missing values, encoded categorical data, converted string features like mileage and engine.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizations, correlations, outlier detection.

Modeling – Linear Regression (baseline, poor results) and Random Forest Regressor (better accuracy).

#📈 #Results

Model	R² Score	RMSE
Linear Regression	~0.45	High
Random Forest	~0.85	Low

✅ Random Forest performed significantly better compared to Linear Regression.

#🚀 #How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
